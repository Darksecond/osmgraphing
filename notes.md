# Notes

Just a place to store arbitrary information, TODOs and so on.
Maybe, it is concept for later documentation, or just keep-up-the-good-work (`kutgw`).


## Ideas

### General

- Implement graph as server, which can execute queries from clients (e.g. via channels).


### Build-script

- A build-script could, maybe, build the inline-size for `SmallVec` dependent of an env-var when compiling.
  The command `include!(...)` could help.
  More info in [this cargo-issue][github/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5624].


### Documentation

- Write down alternative implementation-approaches
  - Implement shortcut-edges more memory-efficient storing list of costs per src-dst-pair instead of per edge.
  - Routing from src-node to dst-node where dst-node has at least the city-level of the src-node.


### Extend tests

- extend routing-tests
  - implement tests comparing ch-dijkstra with normal dijkstra on isle-of-man
  - implement routing-tests for parsed pbf-files (just comparing src-id, dst-id and length)
- Take results from actions of commit f28d88a for parsing-tests (fmi).
- Test personalized routing explicitly using certain alpha-values and new expected paths.


### Extend configs

\-


### Extend parsing

- Use __preprocessing-phase__ for `pbf`-parser to count edges and __allocate memory__ accordingly.
- Print __edit-link__ for weird osm-content (in addition to currently printed warnings).
- Parse lanes (now: use default).
  - tags: `lanes`, `lanes:backward` (`way-id: 33172848`)


### Extend routing

- Implement little parser for a file containing routes.
  Preferred is a format, where every line defines `src, dst`.
  To make this less dependent of a certain map, every node is represented by its coordinate or id instead of its index.
