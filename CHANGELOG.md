## [v0.12.0][github/self/v0.12.0] <a name="v0.12.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.12.0/added"></a>

- Support generating `fmi`-files with __`src`-__ and __`dst`-indices__ as column.
- Extend __configs__
  - Implement __config-parser's categories__ separate from __config-generator's categories__ to guarantee ideal support.
  - Add __`is-ch-dijkstra`__ to routing-config (needing a keyword for `metrics`).
  - Extend parser to __check config__ before starting parsing.
- Support graphs created via __contraction-hierarchies__ and efficient routing on these graphs.
  - Extend the __bidirectional Dijkstra__ to support normal and contracted graphs efficiently with one implementation (using a flag and lazy bool-evaluation).
    - Add __contraction-hierarchies-level__ to nodes.
      Further, let the graphbuilder __sort edge-ids by level__ to allow `break` instead of `continue` when iterating over leaving-edges in the bidirectional CH-Dijkstra.
    - Add `ProtoShortcut`s and replace `ProtoEdge`s.
    - Add very basic parsing-tests.
    - Add __`isle-of-man.ch.fmi`__ and its `config`, and update `pbf-to-fmi.yaml` respectively.
    - Add __`small.ch.fmi`__ and its `config`.yaml` respectively.
    - Extend __parser__ by removing __duplicates__.
      - Add duplicates to some test-maps.
  - Extend the __graph__ to access shortcuts and node-level quickly and memory-efficient (via offsets).
    Make graph-output prettier and add shortcuts.
  - Extend the __graphbuilder__ to build shortcuts and their shortcuts.
  - Extend the __graphbuilder__ to build in different stages.
    This allows a better naming-convention for intermediate proto-edge-types and improves maintenance a lot.
- Add script for doing benchmarks.
- Add script for creating __[flamegraphs][github/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph]__.
- Add many __defaults__
  - Move defaults for `SmallVec`-inline-size into a new submodule `capacity`.
  - Add __metric-unit-defaults__ and use them overall.
  - Add realistic __accuracy-limits__ (`1e-6` is way enough, as explained in the respective module `defaults`, and `EPSILON` could easily fail due to rounding-errors).
  - Add __capacity-defaults__, like the bytes-limit per chunk when building the graph.
- Add __helpers__
  - Add trait `MemSize` considering runtime-dependencies like the number of metrics in a edge.
- Add __units__ and test-cases, and replace many places, where units are relevant.
  - It could make sense to export units as own module (Kilometers, Meters, Seconds, Minutes, Hours, KilometersPerHour)


### Changed <a name="v0.12.0/changed"></a>

- __Config-parser-category `Ignore`__ is allowed to have the id `Ignore`, which may occur multiple times.
  For this, no other config-parser-category is allowed to have an id `Ignore`.
  It's not hardcoded but named after the enum-variant.
- Edit __generated__ `fmi`-map-files.
  - Let generator print ids of the provided config-edge-categories, not their categories.
  - Let generator print `Ignore`-column as `_`.
- Make __graphbuilder__ much more efficient in performance and memory (both around `25 %`).
  - Replace `BTreeMap` of graphbuilder by `Vec` and a handy (forced) way of adding graph-components.
    This needs a replacement of __node-ids by node-indices__ during build-phase.
  - __Replace `f32` by `f64`__ thanks to the new optimized graphbuilder.
- Slightly update repo, updating __code-of-conduct__ and __contributing__ slightly, and replacing __`Apache-2.0-LICENSE`-description__ by a shorter, more general description of it (including purpose).
- Update all maps to be up-to-date (March 14th, 2020).
  - Extend parser by some new special-cases (also from older maps).
- Change how __random routes__ are generated in binary `osmgraphing`, using generators (closures) now.
- Make __graph-access handier__ by adding/editting functions like `MetricAccessor::get_more(...)`.
- Move `SteetType`-documentation into code (where the defaults are set) `:)`.
- Implement __`routing::paths::Path`__ as vector of edge-indices.
  - This improves efficiency, since no extra intermediate node-mapping is needed, which has to be remapped to edges afterwards.
  - Costs are not stored in the path anymore, but can be calculated.
    One reason for this are shortcuts, which could have slightly different cost than their underlying edges due to rounding-errors.
    Thanks to the edge-indices in the path, the path is more flexible.
    It is possible to ask for every possible metric-combination, even for those, which are not optimized by the Dijkstra.
  - Paths can be flattened.
- Cleanup/refactor __module `helpers`__ and __`tests`__ a little.
  - Move __dijkstra-testing__ and __dijkstra-comparison__ into `helpers`, reducing code-duplicates in tests.
  - Extend some tests or refactor some tests.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.12.0/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..


### Removed <a name="v0.12.0/removed"></a>

- Remove `routing::paths::{VecPath, HashPath}`.


### Fixed <a name="v0.12.0/fixed"></a>

- Let scripts check `cargo fmt` before building, so user has to format code manually before running it with the script.
- Using `Vec::splice(...)` in `Dijkstra` is too expensive in performance, hence it has been replaced by `Vec::resize(...)`.
- Let binary `osmgraphing` exit with exit-code non-zero, if an error occurs (before, it just returned).


## [v0.11.1][github/self/v0.11.1] <a name="v0.11.1"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.11.1/added"></a>

- Let __generator__ add the `edge-metric-count`/`dim` to a `fmi`-map-file.


### Changed <a name="v0.11.1/changed"></a>

- Make __example-maps and -configs__ prettier.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.11.1/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..
- Comparing `f32` could be wrong due to hard criterion `<= std::f32::EPSILON`.
- When generating a map, only the parser-config's metrics are counted for setting the generated dimension, but it is possible to generate a map of less metrics.
- The build-script doesn't check format neither formats the code.
- In case of an error, the binary `osmgraphing` does return, with error-code `0`, instead of returning a non-zero exit-code.


### Fixed <a name="v0.11.1/fixed"></a>

- Let __generator convert metrics from kilometers in meters__, because parser does read it in meters.
- Count __param-indices__ correctly in `fmi`-parser by moving `param_idx` out of the loop-head to a mutable variable.


## [v0.11.0][github/self/v0.11.0] <a name="v0.11.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.11.0/added"></a>

- Implement a __`mapgenerator`__ generating `fmi`-map-files by converting from one format to another via config-files.
  - Implement a module `generating`.
  - Generate and test __`isle-of-man.fmi`__ out of `isle-of-man.pbf`.
  - Implement a config for __pbf-to-fmi-conversion__.
- Make __config__ cleaner and more flexible.
  - Add __configs__ for every map, that is being __tested__.
  - Add respective __test-cases__.
  - Add support for `NodeCategory`s and add variants to `EdgeCategory`s.
- Implement a nice trait for __supporting file-extensions__ in a general way.


### Changed <a name="v0.11.0/changed"></a>

- Bring sense to __TOC in `CHANGELOG.md`__.
- Update __`README.md`__.
- Reduce default-inline-size of `SmallVec` from 5 to 4 (`pub const SMALL_VEC_INLINE_SIZE: usize = 4`).
- Move existing module `parsing` and new module `generating` into one module called __`io`__.
- Extend parser's preprocessing by checking config.
- Make __config__ cleaner and more flexible.
  - Refactor config completely by separating strictly between __`raw-config`__ (direct result of deserialization) and the final config-version.
  - Rename __config-attributes__ and __config-methods__.
  - Use `Option<...>` for large config-parts (`parser` vs `generator` vs `routing`).
  - Rename config `schema.yaml` to __`blueprint.yaml`__ to keep the keyword `schema` free.
  - Split __`EdgeCategory::NodeId`__ to `EdgeCategory::SrcId` and `EdgeCategory::DstId`.
  - Let config remember every id (expect for ignore).
- Update `notes.md`.
- Update `ProtoNode`
  - Make graphbuilder's __`ProtoNode`__ public.
  - Let `ProtoNode` remember a `bool` instead of an `edge-count` for the info, whether it is part of an edge.
- Simplify __metric-access__ in graph.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.11.0/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..
- Problem: The generator doesn't convert metrics from kilometers in meters, but parser reads only meters.
- Problem: The `fmi`-parser is not counting the __param-indices__ correctly.
  If the number of `EdgeCategory`s in a config-file for `fmi`-files is higher than the number of elements provided by the `fmi`-parser, the file cannot be parsed.
  This case is relevant since `EdgeCategory`s don't have to be provided by the map-file, but could be calculated.


### Removed <a name="v0.11.0/removed"></a>

- Make __config__ cleaner and more flexible.
  - __Simplify tests__ by creating configs directly (instead of using enum `TestType`).


### Fixed <a name="v0.11.0/fixed"></a>

- Let little __build-script__ stop when error occurs.
- Remove use of `mul_add` to allow compiler to optimize loop (`SIMD`).
- Let graphbuilder remove __edge-duplicates__ (same src, same dst and exactly, not approximately, same metric).
  This will also be efficient for shortcuts wrt contraction-hierarchies.


## [v0.10.0][github/self/v0.10.0] <a name="v0.10.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.10.0/added"></a>

- Add support for __routing-config__ using existing config-files or a str-parser.
  - Let the new routing-config specify the metrics used by the `Dijkstra`.
  - Let the new routing-config specify preferences for each metric.
  - Let the big Config being built by a ProtoConfig to support dependencies between Config-components (like `cfg.routing`, having a list of ids, depends on the mapping from id to idx, which is stored in `cfg.graph`).
  - Add tests considering the routing-config.
- Support __multiple metrics__ in `Dijkstra`, using dot-product with a preference-vector.
- Little __build-script__ for convenience.
- Create __module `helpers`__ collecting handy functions and adding approximation-comparison for `f32` (like `ApproxEq` or `ApproxCmp`).


### Changed <a name="v0.10.0/changed"></a>

- Rename __container-structs__ in graph to accessors, since they are only accessing, not owning the graph's data.
- Refactor and update __`notes.md`__.
- Rename __metric-categories__ in configs as the expected unit (like `Length` -> `Meters`), because explicit is better than implicit.
- Extend __binary `osmgraphing`__
  - Move complexity from examples to binary.
  - Make __examples__ less complex.
  - Let binary accept __logging-level__ as cli-arg.
- Move __module `defaults`__ from `network` to a global module.
  Rename its content accordingly and extend it.
- Refactor __metrics__
  - __Replace units__ `Meters` by `Kilometers` and `Milliseconds` by `Seconds` to keep numbers nearer to `1.0`, which is nearer to the routing-preferences (`alpha`).
    This, hopefully, improves routing-calculations' accuracy.
  - Let very small __non-zero metrics__, which are around (or exactly) `0.0`, be `std::f32::EPSILON` instead of `1.0`.
  - Remove trait `Metric` for more simplicity.
  - Replace all metrics and calculations in `u32` by __`f32`__.
    Coordinates are included and uses `f32` from now.
  - Add __tests__ for unit-conversions/-calculations.
- Improve __memory-consumption__ by using inlining via `SmallVec` at certain spots.
  - Makes the use of `par_iter()` (instead of `iter()`) in `pbf`-parser great again.
- Simplify __graph-access-functions__ by replacing return-values with `panic!`s.
- Rename all occurences of `type` to `category`.
- Make __test-implementations__ fabulous again.
  - Now, the main-test-files are separated and have a cleaner overview than the underscore-naming-convention and the first approach, where all tests have been in one single test-script.
  - Create a module `helpers` containing general implementations, which can be used by the real test-functions.
    This makes the tests cleaner.
  - Testing configs is part of `parsing`-tests.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.10.0/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..


### Removed <a name="v0.10.0/removed"></a>

- Remove __`Astar`__ completely, since this project will be used with multiple (custom) metrics and a graph contracted via contraction hierarchies.
  The old implementation is kept in a `kutgw`-branch.
  This makes the routing-module much less complex.
  - Remove __`unidirectional Dijkstra`__ since the `bidirectional Dijkstra` uses only one priority-queue, so overhead for short routes is, if existent, very small.
  - Remove __generics__, since their main-purpose has been supporting estimation-functions of `Astar`.
    For the cost-functions, use the metric-indices from the routing-config instead.
  - Remove some `CostNode`-implementations.
  - Remove `routing::factory`.
- Remove graph-functions __accessing specific metrics__, so only one access-method remains.
- Replace branch `master` by `nightly` to emphasize the difference between `release`s and `master`.


### Fixed <a name="v0.10.0/fixed"></a>

- Fix markdown-references in old headings in __`CHANGELOG.md`__.
- Replace __`std::process::exit(...)`__ by `panic!(...)` to improve feedback, e.g. in tests (where logging-messages are swallowed).


## [v0.9.0][github/self/v0.9.0] <a name="v0.9.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.9.0/added"></a>

- Implement `zero()` for `geo::Coordinate`.
- Implement trait `Metric` for `u32`.
- Add __format-check__ to github-action (`cargo fmt -- --check`).
- Support __mulitple metrics__, where the number is only known during runtime.
- __Parse graph__ with config instead of map-file, which can be provided as `yaml`-file.
  - Let __metrics__ have __ids__.
  - Let __routing-algorithms__ access graph-metrics with metric-idx.
  - Add __default-configs__ for maps `isle-of-man` and `simple-stuttgart`.
  - Describe every option in a __full config__ (like a __schema__).
  - Support for __different vehicle-categories__.
  - Add __tests__ for deserializing the default-configs.
- Add module __`helpers`__ for general, handy implementations.
  - The struct `MapFileExt` (name before: `Type`) is being moved from module `parsing` to here.
  - __Initializing logging-levels__ is being moved from examples and executables to here.
  - In the future: dot-product


### Changed <a name="v0.9.0/changed"></a>

- Implement clean __ordering-__ and __equal-traits__ for `CostNode`s in the routing-modules.
- Let __github-action__ upload results of benches in a folder called like the commit-hash.
- Let __github-action__ deploy-and-tag only in a branch called `release` to remove `continue-on-error`
- Improve memory-usage, performance and code-style of __metrics__ and __graphbuilding__.
  - Store metrics in the graph as __`Vec<Vec<u32>>`__ (instead of `Vec<Vec<MetricU32>>` or multiple vecs).
  - Access metrics as `u32` or access it as metric (like `Meters`).
  - Let __graphbuilder__ add metrics with __limited memory-usage__.
  - __Consume metrics after adding__ them to graph, but keep ids.
  - __Sort proto-edges unstable__ to sort them fully in-place.
- Simplify __indices-structs__ and __metric-structs__.
  - Make underlying `u32`-values implicit (__`Struct(u32)`__) instead of explicit (`Struct { value: u32 }`).
  - Implement __`Deref`__ and __`DerefMut`__ for them, replacing `value()`, `to_usize()` and similar.
- Push __proto-edges__ in __graphbuilder__ as struct, not as separate attributes.
- Make parser-functions dependent of `self` to add __`preprocessing`-phase__.
  - The __`fmi`-parser__ uses this `preprocessing`-phase to determine the __node- and edge-ranges__ in the provided file using the counts at the beginning of a `fmi`-map-file.
- Rename structs and fields, whose names based on __"type"__, because this is a reserved keyword.
- Make `pbf`-parser __single-threaded__, since runtime's bottleneck is allocating memory many times.
  The runtime for parsing ways single-threaded and multi-threaded was identical (`3:30 minutes` for multi-threaded, `3:20 minutes` for single-threaded).
  The times are much faster, if the RAM has remaining capacity and doesn't have to use the swap-partition, which has been tested with a Germany-fmi-file with half the number of nodes as the Germany-pbf-file.
- Refactor __tests__ making their names uniformly.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.9.0/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..
- `CHANGELOG.md` has wrong markdown-references in old headings.


### Removed <a name="v0.9.0/removed"></a>

- Remove `MetricU32`.
- Due to the new configs, __edge-distances can not be calculated__ for some edges, which are missing this value, but only for all or none.


### Fixed <a name="v0.9.0/fixed"></a>

- Improve graphbuilder's memory-usage.
  By estimating the amount of proto-edges referring to `200 MB` (could be changed in the future), the graphbuilder can add only these proto-edges before reallocating.
  This limits the needed memory-usage.
- Add labels in benches to identify non-existent ids/indices.


## [v0.8.0][github/self/v0.8.0] <a name="v0.8.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.8.0/added"></a>

- Add wiki-content to cargo-documentation and extend `README.md`
- Add file `notes.md` for information, which
  - is not needed anywhere else.
  - is future-documentation.
  - is a future-issue.
- Stop ignoring `Cargo.lock` in `.gitignore`.
- Add __playground-example__ for generating __random numbers__.
- Extend __routing__
  - Implement a bidirectional Astar.
  - Implement a real Dijkstra without estimation-function, meaning explicitly instead of implicitly having the estimation-function returning zero.
  - Extend __routing-factory__ accordingly.
  - __Benchmarks__ for routing-algorithms, added to github-actions as new job uploading results as __artifacts__.
  - Add __new testing-map with respective tests__ especially designed for __baiting__ bidirectional Astar.
    It has paths between some nodes, whose best path wrt smallest weight is not the best path wrt hop-distance.
  - Add random-route-pairs to __astar-example__ basing on random numbers generated by a seeded uniformly distribution.
- Add trait `Display` as dependency for trait `Metric`.


### Changed <a name="v0.8.0/changed"></a>

- Change graph-building
  - __Reduce additional memory-usage__ when building graph.
    Now, when data is not used anymore, but already stored in the graph, it is dropped.
  - Remove `way-id` from the graphbuilder since it is not used anyways.
  - Let parser already deliver metrics instead of primitives.
- Extract the github-action-step `deploy-and-tag` as separate job.
- Change routing
  - Refactor complete module to improve code-structure of new modules (-> see section [`Added`](#v0.8.0/added)).
  - Make `paths`-module more __public__.
    Still keep access to underlying implementation-struct (`VecPath` or `HashPath`) __private__ to be flexible over changes.
  - Merge some __test__-modules to __reduce folder-complexity and redundant code__.
- Rename some methods more explicetly, like `geo::Coordinate::from -> geo::Coordinate::from_64`.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.8.0/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..
- `CostNode`s in the routing-modules are implementing ordering- and equal-traits sloppy.


### Fixed <a name="v0.8.0/fixed"></a>

- In `CHANGELOG.md`, markdown-links (not URLs!) in the table-of-contents should be persistent, meaning `#v1.0.0-yanked` should be `#v1.0.0`.
- In example `astar`, the distance has been printed with two units (`123 m m`).
- Add an alternative best route to a test-case of the small graph, that has been missing.


## [v0.7.1][github/self/v0.7.1] <a name="v0.7.1"></a>

### Changed

- Fix link to `docs.rs` in `README.md`


### Deprecated

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- Routing should be extended by a `bidirectional Astar`.
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..
- Building the graph uses too much additional memory due to not dropping unused data though it is already stored in the graph.


## [v0.7.0][github/self/v0.7.0] <a name="v0.7.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.7.0/added"></a>

- Implement __access to forward-edges and backward-edges__, as preparation to the `bidirectional Dijkstra`, .
  - Process queries for forward-edges and backward-edges by the same code, due to the new pattern with the __shallow containers__.
    To achieve this without additional performance-cost, use a index-mapping for offsets, while accessing all other components (node-indices and metrics) directly.
  - Extend graph-construction-tests for backward-edges.
- Add __documentation__ for the graph.
- Add a __metric-system__ replacing primitive data-types.
  - Support typical calculations as `v = s/t`, typed correctly (`meters / milliseconds -> km/h`).


### Changed <a name="v0.7.0/changed"></a>

- Comment in `Cargo.toml`, over changing the version, to not forget changing the `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Refactor the graph by a new pattern.
  - Add new examples playing around with different patterns (`RefCell` vs `moving` vs `borrowing`).
  - Store the data in arrays in one single struct (the graph), while granting access over layer-structs borrowing these arrays and executing user-queries.
    This makes maintainability without breaking changes easier.
  - Let the graph-interface allow access via `NodeContainer` and `EdgeContainer`.
- Replace the use of usize by new structs, `NodeIdx` and `EdgeIdx`, to control the access to graph-components.
- Refactor logging slightly by adding progress-bars to parsing and building.
- Use a new type-parameter in the `Astar` for a metric-type, which are added in this release.
  - Change the access to best-path-algorithms slightly.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.7.0/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- Routing should be extended by a `bidirectional Astar`.


### Removed <a name="v0.7.0/removed"></a>

- The feature showing whether an `edge is enabled` is being removed to make handling backward-edges easier.
- `Edge-ID`s are not needed and hence removed.
- When building and finalizing the graph, `ProtoNode`s and `ProtoEdge`s don't need ordering implemented, hence these implementations are removed.


## [v1.0.0-yanked][github/self/v1.0.0-yanked] <a name="v1.0.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v1.0.0/added"></a>

- Add `CHANGELOG.md`. `:)`
- Add GitHub-action automatically testing and deploying.
  As improvement over travis-ci, it tags commits automatically if the `Cargo.toml`-version has changed and pushed.
  Before, both (tag and `Cargo.toml`) had to be updated.


### Changed <a name="v1.0.0/changed"></a>

- The `README.md` has no longer `News` due to the new `CHANGELOG.md`.


### Deprecated <a name="v1.0.0/deprecated></a>

- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
- Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
- Inconsistent `semver` in tagging -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The `graph`-interface should allow access via `node`- and `edge`-containers
  - This would improve maintainability and reduce number of breaking changes in the future.
  - Further, it would allow using multidimensional metrics easier an probably improves caching thanks to `Structure of Arrays` instead of currently used `Array of Structures`
- The `graph` containing forward-edges will be extended by backward-edges.
  - The feature showing whether an `edge is enabled` will be removed.
- Routing should be extended by a `bidirectional Astar`.


### Removed <a name="v1.0.0/removed></a>

- The `braess-optimization` has been removed (to a `kutgw`-branch), since it's just kind of a big playground and interferes with future code, at least when testing.
- `Travis-CI` has been replaced by `GitHub`-workflows (-> see section [`Added`](#v1.0.0/added)).
