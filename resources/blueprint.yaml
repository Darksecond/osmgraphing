# The following blueprint contains every possible information.
# Note that ids have to be unique, which is not the case below.
#
# Besides that, a general info about storing the values in the graph:
#
# - Metrics are stored with the unit as provided, but the value itself is stored as f64.
#   This allows you to use the metric in this config with another unit as it has been provided.
#   For now, this doesn't make sense (e.g. converting seconds to meters), but their might be upcoming useful use-cases in the future.
# - Note that conversions are executed for resulting values, not for incoming values.
#   So converting a value from `Meters` to `Kilometers`, where the value has originally been provided in `Seconds`, does work.
#   However, the used value will remain being stored in `Seconds`, if the used conversion-command doesn't convert it in-place (replacing it).
#

# Reads in a graph and generates further information from the provided ones.
# After generating metrics, the generating-sub-config will be deleted and added to the parsing-config directly.
