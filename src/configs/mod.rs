/// Storing (default) settings for parsing the graph.

/// # Configuration
///
/// ## Default
///
/// The default-configuration contains basic metrics of the graph:
/// - length (in meters)
/// - maxspeed (in km/h)
///
///
/// ## Changing the defaults with yaml-file
///
/// You can change the configuration with an input-file (`*.yaml`).
/// With this `yaml`-config, the parser can be adjusted to parse (edge-)metrics in the order as provided by the config-file.
/// This can help especially with map-files in `fmi`-format, since the metrics are read sequentially.
/// But since `pbf`-files does not provide a column-based metric-list, but intrinsically by parsing `osm`-data, you can distinguish between default-metrics and custom-metrics via the key `type`.
///
/// Default-types are
/// - `id`, which is not a metric per se and stored differently, but needed for `csv`-like `fmi`-format
/// - `length` in meters
/// - `maxspeed` in km/h
/// - `duration` in milliseconds
/// - `lane-count`
///
/// Internally, a default-metric uses its type as id and thus can be calculated by other default-types as well (like the duration from length and maxspeed).
/// In case you are using a custom metric, you must specify an id.
///
/// Keep in mind, that metrics (except for id) are stored as `u32` for better maintainability and efficiency.
/// Note that you can convert `floats` into `u32` by moving the comma.
///
///
/// ### Specifying routing
///
/// Further, the metrics, which are used in the routing, can be listed in the routing-section with their previously defined id (or default-id via `type`).
/// Comparisons are made using pareto-optimality, so there is no comparison between metrics.
/// In case you'll use personlized-routing, default-preferences can be set with weights.
/// The example below shows a routing-case, where the metric `length` is weighted with `169 / (169 + 331) = 33.8 %` while the metric `duration` is weighted with `331 / (169 + 331) = 66.2 %`.
///
///
/// ### Supported structure
///
/// The following `yaml`-structure is supported.
/// The used values below are not the defaults.
/// For the defaults, see `resources/configs/default.yaml`.
///
/// Please note, that just a few metric-types can be used multiple times, namely:
/// - type: `id`
/// - type: `custom`
/// - type: `ignore`
///
///
/// Every metric will be stored in the graph, if mentioned in this `yaml`-file.
/// If a metric is mentioned, but `provided` is false, it will be calculated (e.g. edge-length from node-coordinates and haversine).
/// Please note, that metrics being calculated (like the duration from length and maxspeed) need the respective metrics to be calculated.
///
/// ```yaml
/// graph:
///   vehicles:
///     # car|bicycle|pedestrian
///     type: car
///     # Possible values: true|false
///     # Value `false` leads to more edges, because edges are added, which are okay but not suitable for this vehicle-type.
///     is-graph-suitable: false
///   edges:
///     # The order here matters if the map-file has a metric-order, like `fmi`-files.
///     # Each metric below will be stored in the graph.
///     # Metrics below, which have `provided=false`, will be calculated by other metrics and the result is being stored.
///     # All other metrics are calculated, if possible, when asked for.
///     #
///     # Default metrics are length and maxspeed.
///     metrics:
///     # not a metric per se but needed here due to `csv`-like `fmi`-format
///     - id: src-id
///       type: id
///     - type: length
///       # Possible values: true|false
///       # Value `false` leads to calculate the value via coordinates and haversine.
///       provided: false
///     - type: maxspeed
///       # Possible values: true|false
///       # Value `false` leads to calculate the value via length and duration.
///       provided: true
///     - type: duration
///       # Possible values: true|false
///       # Value `false` leads to calculate the value via length and maxspeed.
///       provided: false
///     - type: lane-count
///     - id: <String>
///       type: custom
///     - id: <String>
///       type: ignore
///
/// routing: # example with two metrics and default-weights
///   metrics: [length, duration]
///   preferences:
///   - id: length
///     alpha: 169
///   - id: duration
///     alpha: 331
/// ```
