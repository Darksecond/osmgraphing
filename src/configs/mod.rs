/// # Configuration
///
/// ## Set config-values with yaml-file
///
/// You can change the configuration with an input-file (`*.yaml`).
/// With this `yaml`-config, the parser can be adjusted to parse (edge-)metrics in the order as provided by the config-file.
/// This can help especially with map-files in `fmi`-format, since the metrics are read sequentially.
/// But since `pbf`-files does not provide a column-based metric-list, but intrinsically by parsing `osm`-data, you can distinguish between default-metrics and custom-metrics via the key `category`.
/// Default-categories are described in `MetricCategory`.
///
/// Internally, a default-metric uses provided calculation-rules to be calculated by other default-categories as well (like the duration from length and maxspeed).
///
/// Keep in mind, that metrics (except for id) are stored as `f32` for better maintainability and efficiency.
///
///
/// ### Specifying routing (in the future)
///
/// Further, the metrics, which are used in the routing, can be listed in the routing-section with their previously defined id.
/// Comparisons are made using pareto-optimality, so there is no comparison between metrics.
/// In case you'll use personlized-routing, default-preferences can be set with weights.
/// The example below shows a routing-case, where the metric `length` is weighted with `169 / (169 + 331) = 33.8 %` while the metric `duration` is weighted with `331 / (169 + 331) = 66.2 %`.
///
///
/// ### Supported structure
///
/// The supported `yaml`-structure can be seen in `resources/configs/schema.yaml`.
///
// Every metric (!= every category) will be stored in the graph, if mentioned in this `yaml`-file.
/// If a metric is mentioned, but `provided` is false, it will be calculated (e.g. edge-length from node-coordinates and haversine).
/// Please note, that metrics being calculated (like the duration from length and maxspeed) need the respective metrics to be calculated.
