                // By subtracting the `d-1` neighbors of an arbitrary chosen corner, an underdetermined linear-equation-system can be built and solved, resulting in a line orthogonal to the hyperplane of direction `n`.
                // Further, the dot-product is the orthogonal projection of a vector `v` onto another vector `w`, times the length of w.
                // When comparing two dot-products, where `w` is equal, it is just a comparison of the projections themselves.
                // This statement implies an equal dot-product for each corner of the `d`-dimensional facet with the normal-vector `n`.
                // Since the dot-product uses its vectors as position-vectors, starting from the origin, a shorter dot-product could only be found with a new position-vector, which is outside the facet towards the origin.
                // Interpreting `n` as alpha-vector, this new position-vector would be a cost-vector of a path found by Dijkstra, since Dijkstra optimizes the dot-product between these two vectors, and alpha is fixed.

                // Every new point in cost-space lays on the side of every previously found facet-hyperplane, which is not orientated towards the origin, or the point would have been found earlier.

                //
                // ## Proof of completeness
                //
                // Remaining question is whether the procedure finds all cost-vectors.
                // Let there exist a point `q` in `d`-dimensional cost-space, a cost-vector, inside the `d` border-hyperplanes of an initial convex-hull (dirac-paths).
                // If the point `q` was outside the bounds, it would be part of the initial convex-hull as cost-vector of a dirac-path.
                // Further, let this point `q` be an extreme-point of the convex-hull.
                //
                // Every new alpha leads to a point of maximum distance to the current facet, towards origin due to the definition of the dot-product.
                // Hence, the point `q` has a smaller distance to the current facet and lays inside the yet found facet-hyperplanes, or it would have already been found.
                // This argument holds for every further step.
