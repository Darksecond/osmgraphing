The following description gives an (incomplete) overview about this repository (and resulting binaries), for which the above copyright-notice holds.

This repository `osmgraphing` parses maps of own format or maps from openstreetmap.
To do this, a binary `osmgraphing` is built and an own-defined config-file can be provided to specify parsing-, writing- and routing-settings.
Further, this repository also explorates graphs and optimizes resulting routes with the module `exploration` and the binary `balancer`.
