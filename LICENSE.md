## Short description of some content

This repository "osmgraphing" parses maps of own format or maps from
openstreetmap. To do this, a binary "osmgraphing" is built and an own-
defined config-file can be provided to specify parser- and routing-
settings. Besides that, a binary "mapgenerator" is built and can be used
to generate map-files.
