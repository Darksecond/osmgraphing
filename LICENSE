Purpose

The repository 'osmgraphing' parses maps of own format or maps from
openstreetmap. To do this, a binary 'osmgraphing' is built and an own-
defined config-file can be provided to specify parser- and routing-
settings. Besides that, a binary 'mapgenerator' is built and can be used
to generate map-files.
