# osmgraphing

[![Build Status][www_travis_build_status]][www_travis_builds]

Goal of this student project is parsing [openstreetmap][www_openstreetmap] data to calculate traffic routes on it.

## News

The project setup has been finished and examples can be added easily, which helps a lot when implementing.
The parser is able to parse pbf-files and currently just prints them.
The routing kind of works, but it has to get aligned with the parser.

Now, the bridge between parser and routing is in creation-process by @dominicparga.
Further, we want to visualize the routing via a small Rust-backend/JS-frontend application, where @PraiseTheFun is working on.

We have to submit our project in 1 week and the university is quite stressful these weeks, but test cases (and probably needed cleanup) will follow. :)

## Setup and usage
