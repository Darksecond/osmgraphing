Goal of this student project is parsing [openstreetmap][www_openstreetmap] data to calculate traffic routes on it.

## News

Since automated deployment to `crates.io` is currently (Aug 24th) under work-in-progress, the crate is very unstable and changes a lot.
Of course, this should be finished soon (hopefully Aug 25th o_O).

A lot of repo-work (creating issues, labels, deployments) has been done the past week.
Several branches contain great work (e.g. finished, but unoptimized parser), that has to be merged into the master.
This will be done immediately after the automated deployment is working.

## Setup and usage
