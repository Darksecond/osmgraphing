Welcome to the `osmgraphing`-repo! `:)`
Goal of this repo is parsing [openstreetmap][osm]-data to calculate traffic-routes and different related use-cases on it.
This repo will be involved in dealing with the analysis of selfish routing and learning metrics for balancing load in street-networks.
All calculations should be done effectively on a single desktop instead of an expensive cluster.

## Reason for `version < 1.0.0`

I'm currently building this library for my master-thesis, leading to interface-changes with breaking changes (at least) every few weeks, why version `1.0.0` is not supported yet.
However, the underlying parser and graph-structure are working very stable, efficiently, tested with different maps (see `resources/`), and will be used in `May 2020` to simulate different routing-scenarios, so version `1.0.0` should be reached soon. `:)`


## Setup and usage

### Long story short

Rust has a build-tool called `cargo`, which can be used to run everything except scripts in `scripts/`.

```zsh
# Build the binary for parsing maps and do routing
cargo build --release
# Parse isle-of-man
./target/release/osmgraphing --config resources/config/isle-of-man.pbf.yaml
```

### Download and generate maps

Downloaded osm-data is provided in xml (`osm`) or binary (`pbf`), where nodes are related to location in latitude and longitude.
Problems will be the size-limit when downloading from [openstreetmap][osm], but there are other osm data providers like [geofabrik][geofabrik] for instance.

For testing, some simple text-based format `fmi` is used.
Since they are created manually for certain tasks, parsing them - generally speaking - is unstable.
However, this repository has a generator, which can create such `fmi`-files from `pbf`- or other `fmi`-files (e.g. for different metric-order).
The binary `mapgenerator` (binaries are in `target/release` after release-building) helps with generating proper config-files, but have a look at `resources/configs/blueprint` to get further explanations.
A tool for creating `fmi`-map-files, which contain graphs contracted via contraction-hierarchies, is [multi-ch-constructor][github/lesstat/multi-ch-constructor].


## Requirements for large maps (e.g. countries)

In general, the requirements depend on the size of the parsed map (also same map of different dates) and your machine.
Following numbers base on an __8-core-CPU__ and the `pbf`-maps from `March 14th, 2020` running on `archlinux` with __16 GB RAM__.
Basing on the numbers below, without doing further detailled benchmarks, the memory-usage scales linearly with the graph-size with a growth-factor of `0.5`.
Hence you could expect around `2x` `RAM`-usage for `4x` graph-size (meaning `4x` node- and `4x` edge-count).

In the module `defaults`, you should change the number of inlined metrics (for [`SmallVec`][github/servo/rust-smallvec]) according to your needs.
Several GB can be saved by doing so.

- Parsing `Germany.pbf` (4 metrics, ~51 million nodes, ~106 million edges) needs around __14 GB of RAM__ at peak.
  After parsing, the memory-needs are much lower due to the optimized graph-structure.
- Preprocessing `Germany.pbf` (including parsing) needs less than __4 minutes__.
- A __routing query__ on `Germany.pbf` of distance around `600 km` takes around __22 seconds__ with `bidirectional Dijkstra`, highly depending on the specific src-dst-pair (and its search-space).
  This could be improved by removing intermediate nodes (like `b` in `a->b->c`), but they are kept for now.
  Maybe, they are needed for precise/realistic traffic-simulation.
  An `Astar` is not used anymore, because its only purpose is reducing the search-space, which can be reduced much more using [`Contraction Hierarchies`](#contraction-hierarchies).
  Further, `Astar` has issues when it comes to multiple or custom metrics, because of the metrics' heuristics.

Small maps like `Isle-of-Man.pbf` (~50_000 nodes, ~107_000 edges) run on every machine and are parsed in less than a second.

The German state `Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.pbf` (~9 million nodes, ~18 million edges) needs less than __5 GB RAM__ at peak and around __30 seconds__ to parse.


## Contraction-Hierarchies <a name="contraction-hierarchies"></a>

For speedup, this repository supports graphs contracted via contraction-hierarchies.
The repository [`lesstat/multi-ch-constructor`][github/lesstat/multi-ch-constructor] generates contracted graphs from `fmi`-files of a certain format.
This repository, `osmgraphing`, uses the `lesstat/multi-ch-constructor/master`-branch (commit `bec548c1a1ebeae7ac19d3250d5473199336d6fe`) for its ch-graphs.
For reproducability, the used steps are listed below.

First of all, the tool `multi-ch` needs an `fmi`-map-file of specific format as input.
To generate such a `fmi`-map-file in the correct format, the `mapgenerator` of `osmgraphing` can be used with the `generator-config` shown below, following the [defined requirements][github/lesstat/cyclops/blob/README].

The `Ignore`s are important, because the `multi-ch-constructor` needs the placeholders.
Besides that, the `multi-ch-constructor` uses node-indices as ids, leading to errors when the mapping `node -> indices [0; n]` is not surjective.

```yaml
# Note: old syntax, will be replaced soon.

parser:
  map-file: 'resources/maps/isle-of-man_2020-03-14.osm.pbf'
  vehicles:
    category: 'Car'
    are-drivers-picky: false
  nodes:
  - category: 'NodeId'
  - category: 'Latitude'
  - category: 'Longitude'
  edges:
  - category: 'SrcId'
  - category: 'DstId'
  - category: 'Meters'
    is-provided: false
  - category: 'KilometersPerHour'
  - category: 'Seconds'
    is-provided: false
    calc-rules: ['Meters', 'KilometersPerHour']
  - category: 'Ignore - SrcIdx'
    id: 'SrcIdx'
  - category: 'Ignore - DstIdx'
    id: 'DstIdx'

generator:
  map-file: 'resources/maps/isle-of-man_2020-03-14.fmi'
  nodes:
  - category: 'NodeIdx'
  - category: 'NodeId'
  - category: 'Latitude'
  - category: 'Longitude'
  - category: 'Ignore' # height
  - category: 'Ignore' # level for contraction-hierarchies
  edges:
  - id: 'SrcIdx'
  - id: 'DstIdx'
  - id: 'Meters'
  - id: 'Seconds'
  - id: 'Ignore' # shortcut-edge-0
  - id: 'Ignore' # shortcut-edge-1
```

The `multi-ch`-tool needs 3 counts at the file-beginning: metric-count (dimension), node-count, edge-count.
The `mapgenerator` does add these counts in this order.

Before the `multi-ch`-tool can be used, it has to be built.
For the sake of optimization, you have to set the metric-count as dimension in [multi-ch-constructor/src/multi_lib/graph.hpp, line 49][github/lesstat/multi-ch-constructor/change-dim].
Set this dimension according to the dimension in the previously generated `fmi`-file.

```zsh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lesstat/multi-ch-constructor
cd multi-ch-constructor

cmake -Bbuild
cmake --build build

./build/multi-ch --text path/to/fmi/graph --percent 99.85 --stats --write path/to/new/fmi/graph
```

> Note that the multi-ch-constructor is not deterministic (March 12th, 2020).
> Using it does only speedup your queries, but due to a different resulting order in the priority or rounding-errors, it could lead to different paths of same weight.
